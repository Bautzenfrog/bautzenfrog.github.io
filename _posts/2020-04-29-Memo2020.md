## What will be the future in Germany for my children and me? ## 
It took me eight hours by multiple transfers of trains to join the Memo2020 held in MÃ¼nster in search of an answer. 

Digitalization is mentioned all across the event. Indeed, the virtual connection would save me eight hours by reducing this kind of physical travel, but that investment could be from the education budget from my kids. Even in my wildest dream can I imagine building a cloud castle of digitalization on this land of peasants where the roots of mustards might have a better connection than our broadband or public transportation infrastructure.
