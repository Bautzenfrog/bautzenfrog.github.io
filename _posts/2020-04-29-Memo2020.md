## What will be the future in Germany for my children and me? ## 
It took me eight hours to join the Memo2020 held in Münster by multiple transfers of trains in search of an answer.

Digitalization is mentioned all across the event. Indeed, the virtual connection would save me hours by reducing this kind of physical travel, but that investment could be from the education budget for my kids. Even in my wildest dream, I dare not imagine building a cloud castle of digitalization on this land of peasants where the roots of mustards might have a better connection than our broadband or public transportation infrastructure. 

As an engineer of the historic Waggonbau Bautzen, my perception is that TOC is preserving neither this glorious German tradition nor ordinary people like me, but the DDR past. The free market put us in a cost-first competition. Modern companies like PearITSolution moves production to Czech Repulic while young talents leave Bautzen to other municipalities for a living.

# Now is the time we drive on the trend of technology for a change, think smart and count every penny at hand. #

The transformation shall be humane and sustainable as proposed by G&S. I hesitate to support silicon Saxony policy, feeling that urban Dresden development would further deprive Bautzen’s funding. Service account sounds more like a feasible move with the legal framework developed at the federal level. 

Participating Memo2020 is precious to me; learning from other municipalities’ experiences as well as the most advanced developments in the industry. While both companies have local knowledge of the urgency of digital infrastructure and the need to keep Bautzen talents, MunIT seems to have a broader consideration than PearlITSolution. 

I hope Bautzen city put the priority right, our little mustards over Tiger Mustard, to bring the digitalization breeze to the resilient mustard spirit in every citizen.
